POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CHECK:

1. Import Dependencies:
   - numpy (‚úÖ available)
   - six (‚úÖ available)
   - attr (‚ùå may need: pip3 install attrs)
   - frozendict (‚ùå may need: pip3 install frozendict)

2. Test Environment:
   - Python 3.10.0 (‚úÖ compatible)
   - TensorFlow installation (‚ùå need to build/install)
   - Bazel build system (‚ùå need to install)

3. Common Test Issues:
   - Threading race conditions
   - Device placement errors
   - Memory leaks in session tests
   - Import circular dependencies

4. Recommended Actions:
   - Install Bazel: brew install bazel
   - Install missing dependencies: pip3 install attrs frozendict
   - Build TensorFlow: bazel build //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
   - Run tests: bazel test //tensorflow/python/client:session_test
